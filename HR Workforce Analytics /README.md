# HR Workforce Promotion and Performance Analytics  
Power BI Dashboard Project

This project presents a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze workforce demographics, promotions, performance ratings and job level movement across multiple fiscal years.  
The report highlights patterns in employee progression, gender distribution, hiring balance, and performance among various job levels and age groups.

The analysis is built on a single dataset containing employee-level information.

## Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to support HR and management teams by providing insight into workforce composition and promotion trends.  
The report examines how promotions differ across gender and job levels, how performance ratings relate to job progression, and how age groups and regions are represented across the organization.

The dashboard contains multiple pages displaying workforce metrics before and after fiscal year promotions.
