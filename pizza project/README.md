# Pizza Sales Data Exploration and KPI Analysis  
SQL Project

This project contains a complete SQL analysis of retail pizza sales using the `pizza_sales` table.  
The goal is to generate key performance indicators, identify sales trends, analyze product performance, and prepare metrics suitable for dashboarding or business reporting.

The script includes calculations for revenue, order behavior, customer demand patterns, and product-level rankings.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding overall sales performance and customer ordering behavior through SQL.  
The project computes metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, daily and monthly order trends, category and size contributions, and top-selling pizzas.

These insights are important for restaurant operations, menu optimization, and business decision making.

## Dataset

Table used:

pizza_sales  
Contains order-level transactional data including  
order date, pizza category, pizza size, pizza name, quantity ordered, and total price.

## Analysis Performed

### Revenue and Order Metrics  
• Total revenue generated by all orders  
• Average order value  
• Total number of pizzas sold  
• Total number of unique orders  
• Average number of pizzas per order  

### Daily and Monthly Sales Trends  
• Total orders grouped by day of the week  
• Total orders grouped by month  
This helps identify peak ordering days and seasonal ordering behavior.

### Category and Size Contribution  
Percentage contribution of sales by  
• Pizza category (for a selected month)  
• Pizza size (for a selected quarter)

These insights show which categories and sizes drive the most revenue.

### Product-Level Performance  
Top five pizzas by  
• Total revenue  
• Total quantity sold  
• Total number of orders  

These rankings help determine best-selling and most profitable items on the menu.

## SQL Techniques Demonstrated

• Aggregate calculations using SUM, COUNT and AVG  
• Date functions including DATENAME, MONTH and QUARTER  
• Percentage contribution calculations  
• Sorting and ranking results  
• Grouping data with GROUP BY  
• Filtering data using WHERE conditions  
• Casting and formatting numeric values  

## Files in This Repository

• SQL script containing all pizza sales analysis queries  
• README.md with documentation

This project demonstrates the ability to extract business insights from raw sales data using SQL, focusing on performance monitoring and product-level decision support.
